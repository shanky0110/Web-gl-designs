A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/chrisgannon/pen/WbMoOK.

 I built this as part of a guest post I wrote for Greensock 
http://greensock.com/cube-dial-tutorial
This particular pen illustrates how the numbers on the dial remain the right way round.

Change the 'numFaces' variables for more/fewer numbers.
